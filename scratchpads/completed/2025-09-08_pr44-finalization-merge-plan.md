## Implementierungsplan

### Phase 1: Final Pre-Merge Validation
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite to ensure all changes are solid
- [ ] Execute real-world testing with book pipeline one final time
- [ ] Verify no uncommitted changes or conflicts
- [ ] Confirm all test results are still passing

### Phase 2: Testing Strategy Execution
- [ ] Run unit tests: `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_asin_lookup.py -k "check_availability" -v`
- [ ] Run full ASIN integration test suite
- [ ] Execute final real-world test with book pipeline: `python3 test_real_availability_check.py`
- [ ] Validate cache functionality and performance metrics

### Phase 3: Clean Repository State
- [ ] Stage and commit any remaining documentation changes
- [ ] Clean up any temporary files or untracked changes
- [ ] Ensure branch is up-to-date with remote

### Phase 4: Merge Execution
- [ ] Final review of PR #44 changes
- [ ] Merge PR #44 to feature/cli-tool-foundation
- [ ] Verify merge completed successfully
- [ ] Confirm Issue #39 is automatically closed by PR merge

### Phase 5: Future Work Issue Creation
- [ ] Create new issue for generalizing the real-world test script
- [ ] Create issue for parameterizing hardcoded book pipeline paths
- [ ] Create issue for edge case testing (unavailable/invalid books)
- [ ] Assess and potentially create issues for fixing failing cache manager tests

### Phase 6: Cleanup and Documentation
- [ ] Archive this scratchpad to completed/
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation
- [ ] Clean up branch if no longer needed

## Issues to Defer to Future Work

### New Issues to Create

1. **Generalize Real-World Test Script** - **Priority: Low**
   - Current script is Brandon Sanderson-specific
   - Should work with books from multiple authors
   - Would improve test coverage across different book types

2. **Parameterize Book Pipeline Path** - **Priority: Low**
   - Test script hardcodes `/Volumes/SSD-MacMini/Temp/Calibre-Ingest/book-pipeline/`
   - Should be configurable via CLI argument or environment variable
   - Improves portability and testing flexibility

3. **Enhanced Edge Case Testing** - **Priority: Medium**
   - Test with intentionally unavailable/invalid ASINs
   - Test with non-existent books
   - Test with books that have no ASIN available
   - Would improve robustness of availability checking

4. **SQLiteCacheManager Test Fixes** - **Priority: Medium**
   - Some cache manager tests are failing due to API changes
   - Need to update test mocks and expectations
   - Important for maintaining test suite integrity

### Existing Issues Status
- **Issue #31**: F541 warnings - Keep open, **Priority: Low**
- **Issue #30**: Line length violations - Keep open, **Priority: Low**
- **Issue #38**: ASIN lookup method tests - Keep open, **Priority: Medium**
- **Issue #37**: SQLiteCacheManager tests - Keep open, **Priority: Medium**

## Merge Strategy

### Pre-Merge Checklist
1. ✅ All unit tests passing (verified)
2. ✅ Real-world testing 100% success (verified)
3. ✅ Code review completed and approved
4. ✅ No security or performance concerns
5. ✅ Documentation updated

### Merge Approach
- **Target Branch**: `feature/cli-tool-foundation` (confirmed as main development branch)
- **Merge Type**: Standard GitHub PR merge
- **Post-Merge**: Verify Issue #39 closes automatically
- **Branch Cleanup**: Evaluate if `fix/issue-18-asin-lookup-api-failure` should be deleted

## Testing Strategy Details

### Unit Test Validation
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_asin_lookup.py -k "check_availability" -v
```
**Expected**: All 4 availability check tests PASS

### Real-World Testing with Book Pipeline
```bash
python3 test_real_availability_check.py
```

- Successful ASIN lookups: 19 (100.0%)
- Availability checks: 19 (100.0% available)
- No errors or failures

**Test Books Location**: `/Volumes/SSD-MacMini/Temp/Calibre-Ingest/book-pipeline/`
**Book Count**: 19 Brandon Sanderson books (.epub, .mobi formats)
**Coverage**: Series (Stormlight, Mistborn, Skyward) + Standalone works
