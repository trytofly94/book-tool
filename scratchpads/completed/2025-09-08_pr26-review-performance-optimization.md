## Review Categories

### Critical Issues (Must-Fix)
**Status**: ✅ NONE FOUND
- All integration tests pass
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- Proper error handling throughout

### Suggestions (Should-Fix)
**Status**: MINOR OPTIMIZATIONS IDENTIFIED

1. **Configuration Validation** (Minor):
   - Add validation for rate limit configurations to prevent invalid values
   - Could add warnings for overly aggressive rate limits

2. **Memory Usage** (Minor):
   - Consider adding memory usage tracking in benchmark framework
   - SQLite cache could benefit from periodic VACUUM operations

3. **Logging Levels** (Minor):
   - Some debug logs could be at TRACE level to reduce noise
   - Consider structured logging for better monitoring

### Questions (Clarification Needed)
**Status**: RESOLVED

1. **Migration Strategy**: ✅ Automatic migration with backup implemented
2. **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Fallback to JSON cache if SQLite fails
3. **Performance Claims**: ✅ Validated through integration testing
4. **Configuration**: ✅ Comprehensive configuration options available

## Final Recommendation
**Status**: ✅ APPROVE FOR MERGE
