## PR Reviews Completed

### 1. PR #42: Fix F541 f-string placeholder violations (closes #31)
- **Status**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR MERGE**
- **Assessment Score**: 10/10
- **Risk Level**: Very Low
- **Changes**: 50 F541 violations fixed across 16 files (+281 -45)

#### Key Findings:
- **Perfect Implementation**: All 50 F541 violations systematically eliminated
- **Zero Functionality Impact**: Pure cosmetic string format changes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Legacy scripts, CLI modules, core modules, and tests
- **Quality Validation**: 360 tests pass, CLI tested with 20 real books
- **Best Practices**: Correctly preserves dynamic f-strings, converts static ones

#### Technical Excellence:
```python
# Before (F541 violation)
print(f"  Verwende Standard-Lookup (Datei nicht verfügbar)")

# After (correctly fixed)
print("  Verwende Standard-Lookup (Datei nicht verfügbar)")
```

### 2. PR #40: Fix failing unit tests for SQLiteCacheManager (closes #37)
- **Status**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR MERGE**
- **Assessment Score**: 9.5/10
- **Risk Level**: Very Low
- **Changes**: SQLite test suite fixes (+112 -46)

#### Key Findings:
- **Complete Test Suite Fix**: 10/10 SQLite cache tests now pass (up from 1/10)
- **Realistic Database Testing**: Tests validate actual SQLite operations
- **Production-Ready Coverage**: Database persistence, concurrency, TTL expiration
- **Advanced Features**: Thread safety with WAL mode, corruption handling
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup with `cache_manager.close()` calls

#### Technical Excellence:
```python
# Before: JSON file assumptions
assert cache_manager.cache_data == {}

# After: SQLite database verification
stats = cache_manager.get_stats()
assert stats["total_entries"] == 0
```
