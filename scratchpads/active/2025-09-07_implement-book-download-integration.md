# Implement Book Download Functionality Integration

**Erstellt**: 2025-09-07
**Typ**: Feature Implementation 
**Gesch√§tzter Aufwand**: Mittel
**Verwandtes Issue**: CLI Feature Gap - Download Commands Not Accessible

## Kontext & Ziel

The book-tool project has sophisticated download CLI commands that are fully designed but completely inaccessible to users due to two critical gaps:

1. **Missing Core Implementation**: The CLI imports `BookDownloader` from `calibre_books.core.downloader`, but this class doesn't exist. The current `downloader.py` file mistakenly contains KFX conversion code.

2. **Missing CLI Integration**: The download commands are not imported or added to the main CLI, making them invisible to users even if the core functionality existed.

This represents a significant missed opportunity - users have no access to book downloading capabilities despite having well-designed CLI commands ready for use.

### Current State Analysis

**‚úÖ Completed Download CLI Design:**
- `book-tool download books` - Search/download by series, author, title with quality controls
- `book-tool download batch` - Parallel batch downloads from file lists  
- `book-tool download url` - Direct URL downloads with custom naming
- Complete CLI options, help text, dry-run support, progress tracking
- Proper error handling and Rich console output integration

**‚ùå Missing Components:**
- `BookDownloader` class implementation in `calibre_books.core.downloader`
- CLI integration in `main.py` (import and add_command)
- Configuration support for download settings (`get_download_config()`)

**üéØ Legacy Resources Available:**
- `auto_download_books.py` - Working download automation with librarian CLI integration
- Existing progress tracking and error handling patterns from other modules
- Configuration management infrastructure already established

## Anforderungen

- [ ] Implement complete `BookDownloader` class with all methods expected by CLI
- [ ] Support search downloads by series, author, title with quality/format options
- [ ] Support batch downloads from file lists with parallel processing
- [ ] Support direct URL downloads with custom naming
- [ ] Integrate with existing configuration management system
- [ ] Add download commands to main CLI interface
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing progress tracking and dry-run systems
- [ ] Maintain integration with librarian CLI tool from legacy scripts

## Untersuchung & Analyse

### Legacy Code Analysis - auto_download_books.py
The existing script provides valuable patterns for:
- Integration with librarian CLI tool for actual downloads
- Book search and selection workflows  
- File organization and naming conventions
- Error handling for download failures
- Progress tracking for long-running operations

### CLI Design Analysis - download.py
The existing CLI commands are well-structured with:
- Complete option parsing and validation
- Proper integration with config manager and progress system
- Rich console output with success/failure reporting
- Support for all major download scenarios (search, batch, URL)

### Configuration Requirements
Need to implement `get_download_config()` in ConfigManager returning:
- Default output directory paths
- Preferred formats and quality settings  
- Parallel download limits
- librarian CLI integration settings
- Caching and retry policies

## Implementierungsplan

- [ ] **Phase 1: Core BookDownloader Implementation**
  - [ ] Replace KFX code in `core/downloader.py` with proper BookDownloader class
  - [ ] Implement `download_books()` method for search-based downloads
  - [ ] Implement `download_batch()` method for parallel batch processing
  - [ ] Implement `download_from_url()` method for direct URL downloads  
  - [ ] Add `parse_book_list()` utility for reading batch files
  - [ ] Integrate with librarian CLI following legacy script patterns

- [ ] **Phase 2: Configuration Integration**
  - [ ] Add download configuration schema to config system
  - [ ] Implement `get_download_config()` method in ConfigManager
  - [ ] Add download-specific configuration options and defaults
  - [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing CLI config commands

- [ ] **Phase 3: CLI Integration** 
  - [ ] Add download import to `main.py`
  - [ ] Register download command group in main CLI
  - [ ] Test all download commands are accessible via `book-tool download --help`
  - [ ] Verify dry-run mode works across all download commands

- [ ] **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for BookDownloader class
  - [ ] Add integration tests for CLI command functionality  
  - [ ] Test with librarian CLI tool integration
  - [ ] Validate configuration management integration
  - [ ] Test parallel processing and progress reporting
