**Erstellt**: 2025-09-08
**Typ**: PR Completion & Merge
**Gesch√§tzter Aufwand**: Mittel
**Verwandtes Issue**: GitHub #18
**Branch**: fix/issue-18-asin-lookup-api-failure

## Kontext & Ziel

Complete the PR for fixing ASIN lookup API failures (Issue #18). The main issue has been resolved - title/author searches now work correctly - but we discovered a regression in ISBN lookup functionality during testing. Need to fix the regression, test thoroughly, and merge the PR.

## Anforderungen

- [x] Verify main issue (title/author ASIN lookup) is resolved
- [ ] Fix ISBN lookup regression discovered during testing
- [ ] Test implementation with real books from `/Volumes/SSD-MacMini/Temp/Calibre-Ingest/book-pipeline`
- [ ] Run comprehensive unit tests to ensure no other regressions
- [ ] Create or update documentation if needed
- [ ] Merge PR into main branch (feature/cli-tool-foundation)
- [ ] Clean up development artifacts and close issue

## Untersuchung & Analyse

### Current Status Assessment (2025-09-08)

**‚úÖ RESOLVED: Main Issue (Title/Author Lookups)**
- Testing confirms all 4 test cases from Issue #18 now work:
  - "The Way of Kings" by Brandon Sanderson ‚Üí B0041JKFJW ‚úÖ
  - "Mistborn" by Brandon Sanderson ‚Üí B001QKBHG4 ‚úÖ
  - "Elantris" by Brandon Sanderson ‚Üí B01681T8YI ‚úÖ
  - "Dune" by Frank Herbert ‚Üí B000R34YKC ‚úÖ
- All lookups successful via amazon-search source
- Average lookup time: ~1.7 seconds per query

**‚ùå REGRESSION: ISBN Lookup Functionality**
- ISBN lookup for 9780765326355 failed with "No ASIN found from any source"
- This was working in the original issue report
- Root cause needs investigation

### Prior Art Review
- Existing completed scratchpad: `scratchpads/completed/2025-09-07_issue-18-fix-asin-lookup-api-failure.md`
- Shows comprehensive implementation of 6 phases
- All major lookup sources (Amazon, Google Books, OpenLibrary) implemented
- Issue was marked as completed, but regression testing reveals ISBN issue

### Architecture Analysis
- Current implementation in `src/calibre_books/core/asin_lookup.py`
- ASINLookupService class with separate methods for title/author vs ISBN lookup
- ISBN lookup uses different method chain: `isbn-direct`, `google-books`, `openlibrary`
- Title/author lookup uses: `amazon-search`, `google-books`, `openlibrary`

## Implementierungsplan

### Phase 1: ISBN Regression Analysis & Fix
- [ ] Debug why `_lookup_by_isbn_direct()` method is failing
- [ ] Test Amazon ISBN redirect mechanism (https://www.amazon.com/dp/ISBN)
- [ ] Verify Google Books API ISBN lookup functionality
- [ ] Check OpenLibrary ISBN lookup method
- [ ] Fix the regression without breaking title/author functionality

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing with Real Books
- [ ] Test ASIN lookup with books from `/Volumes/SSD-MacMini/Temp/Calibre-Ingest/book-pipeline`
- [ ] Extract metadata from actual book files to get real ISBN/title/author data
- [ ] Test both lookup paths (ISBN and title/author) with same books
- [ ] Validate all 3 lookup sources work correctly
- [ ] Performance testing to ensure acceptable lookup times

### Phase 3: Unit Test Verification
- [ ] Run existing unit tests to check for other regressions
- [ ] Fix any failing tests due to recent changes
- [ ] Create additional test cases for the ISBN regression specifically
- [ ] Ensure test coverage for both lookup paths

### Phase 4: Documentation and Code Quality
- [ ] Review code comments and docstrings for accuracy
- [ ] Update any relevant CLI help text or documentation
- [ ] Clean up test files and temporary artifacts
- [ ] Ensure proper logging levels for production use

### Phase 5: PR Finalization and Merge
- [ ] Create pull request if none exists
- [ ] Update PR description with comprehensive testing results
- [ ] Reference completed scratchpad and testing artifacts
- [ ] Request code review if needed
- [ ] Merge into feature/cli-tool-foundation branch
- [ ] Close Issue #18
- [ ] Archive scratchpad to completed directory

## Technische Herausforderungen

1. **ISBN Regression Investigation**:
   - Need to determine if the issue is in direct Amazon lookup, Google Books API, or OpenLibrary
   - May be related to ISBN format handling or URL construction

2. **Testing with Real Books**:
   - Extract metadata from actual ebook files requires proper parsing
   - Need to handle different file formats (epub, mobi, etc.)

3. **Avoiding Further Regressions**:
   - Changes to fix ISBN issue must not break the working title/author functionality
   - Need comprehensive testing matrix

## Test-Strategie

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test specific ISBN that was failing
python3 test_asin_current.py  # Current test script

# Test with real books
book-tool asin lookup --isbn "9780765326355" --verbose
book-tool asin lookup --book "The Way of Kings" --author "Brandon Sanderson" --verbose

# Test with books from pipeline directory
# Extract metadata and test multiple formats
```

### Unit Tests
- Run full test suite: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Fix any failing tests related to imports or functionality
- Add specific regression tests for ISBN lookup

### Integration Testing
- Test with actual Calibre library integration
- Verify caching functionality works correctly
- Test error handling and fallback behavior

## Erwartete Ergebnisse

3. ‚úÖ All unit tests pass
4. ‚úÖ Real book testing shows reliable functionality
5. ‚úÖ PR merged and Issue #18 closed

7. üßπ Development artifacts cleaned up

## Fortschrittsnotizen

### Initial Assessment - 2025-09-08 13:00
- ‚úÖ Confirmed main issue is resolved - title/author lookups working perfectly
- ‚ùå Discovered ISBN lookup regression during testing
- üìã Created comprehensive test script that reproduces both success and regression
- üéØ Next: Debug ISBN lookup failure in `_lookup_by_isbn_direct()` method

### Root Cause Analysis - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] Investigate Amazon ISBN redirect URL format - Found ISBNs don't redirect to Kindle ASINs
- [x] Test Google Books API with ISBN queries - Works but doesn't return ASINs directly
- [x] Check OpenLibrary ISBN lookup implementation - Functional but limited ASIN coverage
- [x] Document specific failure points - ISBN for hardcover, need Kindle ASIN separately

**Root Cause**: ISBN 9780765326355 is for hardcover edition. Kindle edition has separate ASIN B0041JKFJW. Amazon doesn't automatically redirect ISBN to Kindle ASIN. Solution: Two-step lookup via Google Books metadata.

### Regression Fix - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement fix for ISBN lookup - Added two-step lookup process
- [x] Verify fix doesn't break title/author functionality - All original tests still pass
- [x] Test with multiple ISBN formats (10-digit, 13-digit) - Both working correctly
