# Calibre Database Integration Implementation (Issue #9)

**Erstellt**: 2025-09-07
**Typ**: Enhancement
**Geschätzter Aufwand**: Groß
**Verwandtes Issue**: GitHub #9

## Kontext & Ziel

Transform the TODO stub methods in `src/calibre_books/core/calibre.py` into full Calibre database integration functionality. Currently, the `CalibreIntegration` class contains placeholder implementations that return mock data. This implementation will provide real functionality using Calibre's CLI tools (`calibredb`) and direct database access patterns.

The implementation must support the test library at `/Volumes/Entertainment/Bücher/Calibre-Ingest` and maintain backward compatibility with the existing CLI interface.

## Anforderungen

### Core Functionality Requirements
- [ ] Real library analysis using `calibredb` commands
- [ ] Actual book retrieval from Calibre database with filtering
- [ ] ASIN update functionality using Calibre metadata management
- [ ] Duplicate book detection and removal with user confirmation
- [ ] Metadata repair and normalization across all books
- [ ] Orphaned file cleanup with space calculation
- [ ] Search index rebuilding using Calibre tools
- [ ] Library export in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- [ ] Advanced book search with complex queries

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integration with Calibre CLI tools (`calibredb`, `ebook-meta`)
- [ ] Robust error handling for external command failures
- [ ] Progress reporting for long-running operations
- [ ] Dry-run mode for all destructive operations
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of all operations
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Linux focus)

### Data Safety Requirements
- [ ] Backup creation before destructive operations
- [ ] Transaction-like behavior where possible
- [ ] User confirmation for irreversible actions
- [ ] Detailed operation reporting and rollback information
- [ ] Safe handling of concurrent Calibre access

## Untersuchung & Analyse

### Existing Code Structure Analysis
The current `CalibreIntegration` class in `src/calibre_books/core/calibre.py` provides:
- **Configuration Management**: Proper setup with ConfigManager integration
- **Method Signatures**: Complete interface definitions with proper typing
- **Logging Infrastructure**: LoggerMixin integration for consistent logging
- **Error Handling Framework**: Basic exception handling patterns

**Methods Requiring Implementation:**
1. `get_library_stats()` - Currently returns placeholder LibraryStats
2. `get_books_for_asin_update()` - Currently returns empty list
3. `update_asins()` - Currently returns mock update count
4. `remove_duplicates()` - Currently returns empty Result
5. `fix_metadata_issues()` - Currently returns empty Result
6. `cleanup_orphaned_files()` - Currently returns empty Result with space calculations
7. `rebuild_search_index()` - Currently passes without action
8. `export_library()` - Currently returns mock export Result
9. `search_library()` - Currently returns empty book list

### Calibre CLI Tools Analysis
Based on Calibre documentation and existing codebase patterns:

**Primary Tools:**
- `calibredb list` - Query books with filters and output formats
- `calibredb show_metadata` - Get detailed metadata for specific books
- `calibredb set_metadata` - Update book metadata including custom columns
- `calibredb add_custom_column` - Manage custom metadata columns
- `calibredb remove_duplicates` - Built-in duplicate detection and removal
- `calibredb export` - Export library data in various formats
- `calibredb check_library` - Integrity checking and repair
- `ebook-meta` - Direct file metadata manipulation

**Command Pattern Examples:**
```bash
# Get all books with specific fields
calibredb list --fields=title,authors,series,pubdate --library-path /path/to/library

# Get books without ASIN (custom column)
calibredb list --search="not asin:true" --library-path /path/to/library

# Update metadata for specific book
calibredb set_metadata book_id --field asin:B01234567X --library-path /path/to/library

# Find duplicates
calibredb show_duplicates --library-path /path/to/library
```

### Prior Art from Existing Scripts
From analysis of completed scratchpads, relevant patterns:
- **ASIN Management**: `calibre_asin_automation.py` shows patterns for ASIN lookup and updating
- **Metadata Handling**: Existing scripts use `subprocess` for `calibredb` interaction
- **Error Patterns**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Configuration**: External configuration management with sensible defaults

### Testing Strategy Analysis
Testing approach needs to handle:
- **External Dependencies**: Mock `calibredb` commands for unit tests
- **Real Library Testing**: Integration tests with actual Calibre library
- **File System Operations**: Safe testing without corrupting real libraries
- **Error Conditions**: Network failures, corrupted databases, permission issues
- **Performance Testing**: Large library operations and progress reporting

## Detaillierte Architektur

### Calibre CLI Wrapper Design
```python
class CalibreDB:
    """Low-level wrapper for calibredb CLI commands."""
    
    def __init__(self, library_path: Path, cli_path: str = 'auto'):
        self.library_path = library_path
        self.cli_path = self._detect_calibre_cli(cli_path)
    
    def execute_command(self, command: List[str], **kwargs) -> subprocess.CompletedProcess:
        """Execute calibredb command with proper error handling."""
        pass
    
    def list_books(self, fields: List[str] = None, search: str = None, 
                   limit: int = None, offset: int = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """List books with filtering and field selection."""
        pass
    
    def get_metadata(self, book_id: int) -> Dict:
        """Get detailed metadata for specific book."""
        pass
    
    def set_metadata(self, book_id: int, metadata: Dict) -> bool:
        """Update metadata for specific book."""
        pass
    
    def find_duplicates(self) -> List[List[int]]:
        """Find duplicate books in library."""
        pass
```

### Progress Reporting Interface
```python
class ProgressReporter:
    """Standard progress reporting interface."""
    
    def start_operation(self, operation: str, total: int):
        """Start a new operation with total item count."""
        pass
    
    def update_progress(self, current: int, message: str = None):
        """Update progress with current item count."""
        pass
    
    def finish_operation(self, message: str = None):
        """Mark operation as complete."""
        pass
    
    def report_error(self, error: str):
        """Report an error during operation."""
        pass
```

### Configuration Integration
The implementation will use existing ConfigManager patterns:
```python
# From ConfigManager
calibre_config = {
    'library_path': '/Volumes/Entertainment/Bücher/Calibre-Ingest',
    'cli_path': 'auto',  # auto-detect or explicit path
    'backup_before_operations': True,
    'dry_run_by_default': False,
    'custom_columns': {
        'asin': 'text',  # Custom column for ASIN storage
        'goodreads_id': 'text',
        'last_updated': 'datetime'
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
class CalibreError(Exception):
    """Base exception for Calibre operations."""
    pass

class CalibreNotFoundError(CalibreError):
    """Calibre CLI tools not found."""
    pass

class LibraryNotFoundError(CalibreError):
    """Calibre library not found or inaccessible."""
    pass

class MetadataError(CalibreError):
    """Metadata operation failed."""
    pass
```

### Data Validation Framework
```python
class CalibreValidator:
    """Validation utilities for Calibre data."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate_library_path(path: Path) -> bool:
        """Check if path contains valid Calibre library."""
        return (path / 'metadata.db').exists()
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate_book_metadata(metadata: Dict) -> List[str]:
        """Validate book metadata and return list of issues."""
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize filename for file system compatibility."""
        pass
```
